# trash

trash is a tui fronted for [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/), written in bash.

This project was inpired by [torque](https://github.com/dylanaraps/torque/blob/master/README.md). I extended it's feature set and changed how it queries information from transmission-daemon to be able to display more info about a torrent (for example availability, seed ration, etc).

## Dependencies

* bash
* transmission-cl

## Usage

Just run trash. You can lauch transmission-daemon by pressing the letter 'l' (you have to have transmission-daemon installed of cource). You can also terminate it with the letter 't'. All keybindings listed at the bottom while trash is running.
